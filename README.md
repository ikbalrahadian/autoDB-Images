# autoDB-Images
autoDB Images is a program to run automatically compressing images from geoTIFF to ECW format in database server. ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet) is a proprietary wavelet compression image format optimized for aerial photography and satellite imagery. It was developed by Earth Resource Mapping, and is now owned by Intergraph part of Hexagon AB. The lossy compression format efficiently compresses very large images with fine alternating contrast while retaining their visual quality, ECW format can compressed images up to 90% from initial size. This program generally works by searching for images by name and extension on the server database, downloading, converting, and re-uploading the converted images to the server.
